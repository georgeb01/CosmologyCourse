\section{The radiation content of the Universe}
\begin{itemize}
\item Galaxy surveys tell us that the density of stars in the Universe corresponds to about $1.7~{\rm L\odot~Mpc^{-3}}$.
\item If, as an upper limit, we assume that these stars have emitted photons since the beginning of the Universe, $4.5\times10^{17}~{\rm s}$ ago, it corresponds to an energy density arising from stellar photons of: $10^{15}~{\rm J m^{-3}}$.
\item The other main source of photons in the Universe is the CMB.
\item The spectrum of the CMB is a black body of $T=2.7~K$, so we can calculate its energy density using:
\begin{equation}
E = \alpha T^4
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\alpha=\frac{\pi^2}{15}\frac{k^4}{\hbar^3 c^3}=7.566\times10^{-16}~{\rm J~m^{-3}~K^{-4}}=0.2606~{\rm MeV~m^{-3}}
\end{equation}
and $k$ is the Boltzmann constant.
\item So the energy density of the CMB is {\it at least} a factor of 40 times that of stellar photons.
\item Despite this, the energy density of the CMB still represents only a small fraction of the critical density of our Universe (i.e., $\Omega_{\rm p} = 5.35\times10^{-5}$).
\item However, because the energy of each CMB photon is very low, $hf_{\rm mean}=6.34\times10^{-4}~{\rm eV}$, the number density of CMB photons (i.e., the number of photons per unit volume) is very high:
\begin{equation}
n_{\rm p} = \frac{0.2606\times10^6}{6.34\times10^{-4}}=4.107\times10^8~{\rm m^{-3}}
\end{equation}
\item Indeed, compared to the number density of Baryons:
\begin{equation}
    n_{\rm b} = \frac{\Omega_{\rm b,0}\vep{_{c,0}}}{E_{\rm b}}=\frac{0.048\times4890~{\rm MeV~m^{-3}}}{939~{\rm MeV}} = 0.25~{\rm m^{-3}}
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\section{Recombination}
\begin{itemize}
\item In an expanding universe, such as our own, as we go further back in time the scale factor, $a$, gets smaller and smaller.
\item This, in turn, means that the wavelength of CMB photons get shorter and shorter, meaning their energies get higher and higher.
\item Since the mean energy, $E$, of a CMB photon is related to temperature, $T$, via $E=2.7kT$ (where $k$ is the Boltzman constant), we can calculate the temperature of the Universe as a function of $a$:
\begin{equation}
    hf_{\rm mean}=\frac{hc}{\lambda_{\rm mean}}=\frac{hc}{a\lambda_0} = 2.7kT(a)
\end{equation}
or, equivalently, $T(a) = T_0/a$, where $T_0$ is the temperature of the CMB today (i.e., 2.755\ K).
\item If we go far enough back in time, then the energies of a large proportion of CMB photons exceed that of the ionisation energy of Hydrogen.
\item And since there are 1.6 billion CMB photons for every Baryon, the instant an electron binds to a proton to form a Hydrogen atom, it gets blasted apart by an ionising photon.
\item However, as the Universe expands, the photons and electrons move further away from each other, so they interact less.
\item If nothing were to change, the distance between the photons and electrons would become so large that they would eventually stop interacting.
\item Before that happens, however, we get recombination.
\item As the Universe expands, the energy of the CMB photons drops as their wavelengths increase.
\item Recombination occurs when there are insufficient numbers of photons with energy greater than the ionisation energy of Hydrogen to keep it ionised.
\item When does this occur?
\item One guess would be when the mean energy per photon drops below the ionisation energy of Hydrogen. With the mean photon energy given by $2.7kT$, this corresponds to:
\begin{equation}
T_{\rm rec} = \frac{13.6}{2.7k}=\frac{13.6}{2.7\times8.6\times10^{-5}}\sim60,000~{\rm K}
\end{equation}
which occured when $a=2.7/60000=4.5\times10^{-5}$, or $z\sim22,000$.
\item However, it turns out this is a poor guess.
\item The reason being that, with 1.6 billion photons per baryon, the Universe doesn't need roughly {\it half} the CMB to be able to ionise H, it needs a much smaller fraction.
\end{itemize}
