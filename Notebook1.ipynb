    "For this exercise, we'll consider a universe that is entirely empty aside from three \"light\" particles (as in the first-year mechanics sense of light, i.e., negligible mass). We'll call them $p_i$, where $i$ is in the range 0..2 (for three particles). These light particles have such low mass that they do not interact with each other gravitationally. As such, there are no forces acting on these particles, so they do not experience any accelerate. At this point, the particles are at positions ($x_i$, $y_i$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider what happens when the universe these particles are in starts to expand. The particles will be dragged along with the expansion of the universe, as if they are resting on an elastic sheet that is being stretched in all directions. The following code calculates the positions of the particles after the universe has expanded in size by a factor of $a$:   "
